# Hotel-networking-project
## Introduction
The Modern Hotel requires a sophisticated networking solution to support its diverse departmental needs across three floors. Each floor contains critical departments that must communicate seamlessly while maintaining secure and efficient data management.

### First Floor: Reception, Store, and Logistics departments
### Second Floor: Finance, HR, and Sales/Marketing departments
### Third Floor: IT and Admin departments
This project leverages Cisco Packet Tracer to design and simulate a network that meets these requirements, ensuring high performance, security, and manageability.
## Features
Seamless Communication: Ensures efficient communication between departments across all floors.
High Performance: Optimized network design for minimal latency and high throughput.
Security: Implements robust security measures to protect sensitive data and departmental interactions.
Manageability: Simplifies network management and troubleshooting with clear network segmentation.
## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project in Cisco Packet Tracer:

Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/hotel-networking-project.git
Navigate to the project directory
bash
Copy code
cd hotel-networking-project
Open the project file in Cisco Packet Tracer
## Usage
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
Load the project file located in the cloned repository.
Explore the network design and configurations.
Run simulations to observe network performance and behavior under different scenarios.
Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance the network design or add new features. To contribute, follow these steps:

Fork the repository
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature)
Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature')
Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature)
Open a pull request
## Tentative Output
The expected output of this project is a fully functional Hotel Management System prototype, implemented and tested within the Cisco Packet Tracer environment. The prototype will demonstrate the key features outlined above and showcase the integration of various modules to automate hotel operations effectively. Additionally, documentation including system architecture, user manuals, and troubleshooting guides will be provided to facilitate understanding and future maintenance of the system.
